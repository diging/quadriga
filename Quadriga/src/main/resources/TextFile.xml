	<text>Two Shōkaku-class aircraft carriers, Shōkaku and Zuikaku, were
		commissioned by the Imperial Japanese Navy during World War II. They
		participated in the attack on Pearl Harbor, the Indian Ocean Raid, and
		the battles of the Coral Sea, the Eastern Solomons, and the Santa Cruz
		Islands. Their air groups sank two of the four fleet carriers lost by
		the United States Navy during the war in addition to one elderly
		British light carrier. Returning to Japan after the Battle of the
		Coral Sea to repair damage and replace lost aircraft, they missed the
		Battle of Midway in June 1942. After the catastrophic loss of four
		carriers during that battle, they formed the bulk of Japan's carrier
		force for the rest of the war. Shōkaku was sunk by an American
		submarine during the Battle of the Philippine Sea in June 1944 as the
		Americans invaded the Mariana Islands, and Zuikaku was sacrificed as
		part of a decoy force four months later in the Battle of Leyte Gulf,
		both with heavy loss of life. Historian Mark Peattie called them
		"arguably the best aircraft carriers" of the early 1940s.</text>
